                        climate system, an aspect of climate change shown by temperature measurements and by multiple
                        effects of the warming. Though earlier geological periods also experienced episodes of warming,
                        the term commonly refers to the observed and continuing increase in average air and ocean
                        temperatures
                        since 1900 caused mainly by emissions of greenhouse gasses in the modern industrial economy.
                        In the modern context the terms global warming and climate change are commonly used
                        interchangeably,
                        but climate change includes both global warming and its effects, such as changes to
                        precipitation and
                        impacts that differ by region. Many of the observed warming changes since the 1950s are
                        unprecedented
                        in the instrumental temperature record, and in historical and paleoclimate proxy records of

                        infrared

                        atmosphere and the surface. On Earth, an atmosphere containing naturally occurring amounts of
                        greenhouse
                        gases causes air temperature near the surface to be warmer by about 33 °C (59 °F) than it would
                        be
                        in
                        their absence. Without the Earth's atmosphere, the Earth's average temperature would be well

                        the
                        freezing temperature of water. The major greenhouse gases are water vapour, which causes about
                        36–70% of
                        the greenhouse effect; carbon dioxide (CO2), which causes 9–26%; methane (CH4), which causes
                        4–9%;
                        and
                        ozone (O3), which causes 3–7%. Human activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased the

                        Between
                        1900
                        and 2016, the sea level rose by 16–21 cm (6.3–8.3 in). More precise data gathered from satellite
                        radar
                        measurements reveal an accelerating rise of 7.5 cm (3.0 in) from 1993 to 2017,1554 which is a
                        trend
                        of
                        roughly 30 cm (12 in) per century. This acceleration is due mostly to human-caused global
                        warming,
                        which
                        is driving thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of land-based ice sheets and glaciers.
                        Between
                        1993 and 2018, thermal expansion of the oceans contributed 42% to sea level rise; the melting of
                        temperate glaciers, 21%; Greenland, 15%; and Antarctica, 8%. Climate scientists expect the rate
                        to
                        further accelerate during the 21st century. The sea level will not rise uniformly everywhere on
                        Earth,
                        and it will even drop in some locations.</p>
